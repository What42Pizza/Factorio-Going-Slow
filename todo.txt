Current:
add graphics for burner miner mk2
add sulfuric acid to solar panel recipe? (solar panels don't fit vibe, but I don't want to fully remove the only ups-friendly energy)
increase wall health
make inserter capacity increases easier
//replace burner miner mk2 with steam powered version of electric miner?
add multiple types of mk2 miners (default, productivity, no pollution, more?)
add chemical science to military science prereqs
add pollution to trains? (probably a bad idea, biters might attack it)
increase player craft speed to 1.5? (might not be possible)
add circuits to electronics research? (would require A LOT of work)
add steam power to everything possible
add language files
overhaul science packs?
add logging settings
add later science for landfill or cliff explosives?
look into also removing items, not just researches?
rename automation science to basic science?
overhaul nuc. reactors? (probably should be its own mod)
	idea:
		inner loop:
			(pressurized water - depleted uranium) -> [uranium infuser] -> (pressurized water - activated uranium) -> [reactor] ->
			(pressurized steam - dirty uranium) -> [waste scrubber] -> (pressurized steam - depleted uranium) -> [turbine] ->
			(steam - depleted uranium) -> [condenser] -> (water - depleted uranium) -> [pressurizer] -> (pressurized water - depleted uranium) -> loop
		condenser loop:
			[pump] -> (water) -> [condenser] -> (steam) -> [any]
		alternate inner loop:
			(pressurized water - depleted uranium) -> [uranium infuser] -> (pressurized water - activated uranium) -> [reactor] ->
			(pressurized steam - dirty uranium) -> [waste scrubber] -> (pressurized steam - depleted uranium) -> [pressurized condenser] ->
			(water - depleted uranium) -> [pressurizer] -> (pressurized water - depleted uranium) -> loop
		pressurized condenser loop:
			[pump] -> (water) -> [pressurized condenser] -> (steam (a lot)) -> [any]



Finished:
